# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

The purpose of this project is to develop an automated way of gauging the sentiments of any topic based on social media, specifically Twitter, using a web service. The web application should determine the sentiment of the Twitter community with respect to a given topic, without looking at traditional news sources. The product name will be Twitter Sentiment Analysis.
The intended user will be a member of the general public who is interested in the sentiment of the Twitter population with respect to various topics. Users are not expected to have a very high level of technical expertise.
